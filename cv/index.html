				<p>A data engineer and data analyst engaged in big data infrastructure, data preprocessing, data cleaning and modeling. Now I focus on the analysis of tool or process data during manufacturing wafer and help the factory improve the yield of production by statistical methods.

				I love to challenge any new technology or new method of machine learning / statical model. Enjoy to handling the whole data stream from raw data to the result of analysis. Currently serving to the BBS boards Statistics and R at Ptt.cc.</p>

				<h2>Degrees</h2>
				<p><strong><abbr title="Master of Statistics">Statistics</abbr>, National Cheng Kung University (國立成功大學), Tainan, Taiwan, 2014</strong><br><em>A Classification Approach Based on Density Ratio Estimation with Subspace Projection</em>.</p>

				<p><strong>BA, Economics &amp Statistics (double majors), National Cheng Kung University (國立成功大學), Tainan, Taiwan, 2012</strong></em>.</p>

				<h2>R Packages</h2>
				<p><strong><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppBlaze/index.html">RcppBlaze</a></strong><br>'Blaze' is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library for dense and sparse arithmetic. With its state-of-the-art Smart Expression Template implementation 'Blaze' combines the elegance and ease of use of a domain-specific language with 'HPC'-grade performance, making it one of the most intuitive and fastest C++ math libraries available. The 'Blaze' library offers: - high performance through the integration of 'BLAS' libraries and manually tuned 'HPC' math kernels - vectorization by 'SSE', 'SSE2', 'SSE3', 'SSSE3', 'SSE4', 'AVX', 'AVX2', 'AVX-512', 'FMA', and 'SVML' - parallel execution by 'OpenMP', C++11 threads and 'Boost' threads ('Boost' threads are disabled in 'RcppBlaze') - the intuitive and easy to use API of a domain specific language - unified arithmetic with dense and sparse vectors and matrices - thoroughly tested matrix and vector arithmetic - completely portable, high quality C++ source code The 'RcppBlaze' package includes the header files from the 'Blaze' library with disabling some functionalities related to link to the thread and system libraries which make 'RcppBlaze' be a header-only library. Therefore, users do not need to install 'Blaze and' the dependency 'Boost'. 'Blaze' is licensed under the New (Revised) BSD license, while 'RcppBlaze' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to 'Blaze') is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'. Note that since 'Blaze' has committed to C++14 commit to C++14 which does not used by most R users from version 3.0, we will use the version 2.6 of 'Blaze' which is C++98 compatible to support the most compilers and system.</p>

				<p><strong><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/milr/index.html">milr</a></strong><br>The multiple instance data set consists of many independent subjects (called bags) and each subject is composed of several components (called instances). The outcomes of such data set are binary or multinomial, and, we can only observe the subject-level outcomes. For example, in manufactory processes, a subject is labeled as "defective" if at least one of its own components is defective, and otherwise, is labeled as "non-defective". The 'milr' package focuses on the predictive model for the multiple instance data set with binary outcomes and performs the maximum likelihood estimation with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm under the framework of logistic regression. Moreover, the LASSO penalty is attached to the likelihood function for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection.</p>
